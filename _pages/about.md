I am an Assistant Professor at the [School of Data Science and Engineering](https://dase.ecnu.edu.cn/), East China Normal University (ECNU). I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science and Technology from the Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences (IIIS) at Tsinghua University, where I was very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Huanchen Zhang](https://people.iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/~huanchen/). Prior to that, I obtained my bachelor’s degree from Nankai University in 2020.

My research interests focus on high-performance database systems, AI-powered data systems, and AI infrastructure. I aim to design practical, efficient, and scalable systems that support both data-intensive applications and intelligent computing.
