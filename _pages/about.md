I am a Ph.D. candidate in [Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences (IIIS)](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), advised by [Prof. Huanchen Zhang](https://people.iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/~huanchen/). Before coming to Tsinghua, I obtained my bachelor’s degree from Nankai University in 2020. My research interests mainly lie in indexing data structures, AI for DB, data storage and cloud databases.
