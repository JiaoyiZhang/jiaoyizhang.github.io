![pages-build-deployment](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/actions/workflows/pages/pages-build-deployment/badge.svg)

Academic Pages is a Github Pages template for academic websites.


# Getting Started

1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Click the "Use this template" button in the top right.
1. On the "New repository" page, enter your repository name as "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and add your content.
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the `files/` directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section
1. (Optional) Use the Jupyter notebooks or python scripts in the `markdown_generator` folder to generate markdown files for publications and talks from a TSV file.

## Running Locally

This repository has been tested locally with the system Ruby available on this machine (`ruby 2.6.10`) by pinning `ffi` to a Ruby-2.6-compatible version and installing gems into `vendor/bundle`.

### One-time setup

Run these commands in the project root:

```bash
bundle install --path vendor/bundle
```

This installs Jekyll and the site dependencies locally inside the repository.

### Start the local preview server

Use:

```bash
./dev.sh
```

Or run Jekyll directly:

```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve -l -H localhost
```

Then open:

```text
http://localhost:4000
```

### Useful local test commands

Check whether the site can be generated:

```bash
bundle exec jekyll build
```

Clean generated artifacts if needed:

```bash
bundle exec jekyll clean
```

### Notes

- If Bundler says it cannot reach `rubygems.org`, rerun the install when your network is available.
- `github-pages` may print a warning about missing GitHub API authentication during local builds. That warning is usually safe to ignore for local preview.
- If you later upgrade Ruby, you can delete `vendor/bundle` and run `bundle install --path vendor/bundle` again.

# Maintenance 

Bug reports and feature requests to the template  should be [submitted via GitHub](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/issues/new/choose). For questions concerning how to style the template, please feel free to start a [new discussion on GitHub](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/discussions).

This repository was forked (then detached) by [Stuart Geiger](https://github.com/staeiou) from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/), which is © 2016 Michael Rose and released under the MIT License (see LICENSE.md). It is currently being maintained by [Robert Zupko](https://github.com/rjzupkoii) and additional maintainers would be welcomed.

## Bugfixes and enhancements

If you have bugfixes and enhancements that you would like to submit as a pull request, you will need to [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo) this repository as opposed to using it as a template. This will also allow you to [synchronize your copy](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork) of template to your fork as well.

Unfortunately, one logistical issue with a template theme like Academic Pages that makes it a little tricky to get bug fixes and updates to the core theme. If you use this template and customize it, you will probably get merge conflicts if you attempt to synchronize. If you want to save your various .yml configuration files and markdown files, you can delete the repository and fork it again. Or you can manually patch.
